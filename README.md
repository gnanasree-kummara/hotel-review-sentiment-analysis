This project performs sentiment analysis on hotel reviews to classify them as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLP (TF-IDF)
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for basic web interface)

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Sentiment classification on 1000+ hotel reviews
- Simple web-based interface for prediction

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand text preprocessing, feature extraction, and building machine learning models for NLP-based sentiment analysis.

## Acknowledgement
This project was inspired by an open-source implementation and was modified and extended for academic learning purposes.
